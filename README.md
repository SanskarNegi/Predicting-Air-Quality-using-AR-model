# Predicting-Air-Quality-using-AR-model

Predicting Air Quality (PM2.5) readings using AutoRegressive Model from statsmodel.

This Project is created to build a model that predict the PM2.5 readings using AutoRegresssive model from statsmodels. In this project we tune our hyperparameter to improve model's performance.
